- Working with:
- PostgreSQL (core database)
- Redis (queues, caching, session/state management)
- Docker (containerised local development)
- Cloud deployment pipelines (Railway, AWS, etc.)
- Implementing robust API design, modular architecture, and secure coding practices
- Participating in code reviews and daily development workflows with senior engineers
# What We Are Looking For

- Strong interest in AI/LLM development (training, inference, or prompt-based systems)
- Basic understanding of:
- RESTful API design
- Async Python
- Git/GitHub workflows
- PostgreSQL fundamentals
- High integrity, strong work ethic, and ambition to become a top-tier developer
- Fast learner with good problem-solving ability

- 3-6 month structured, hands-on training program
# Exposure to:
- Real-world AI voice agent development
- Building production-grade FastAPI services
- API orchestration and backend workflow automation
- Direct mentorship from senior engineers
- A pathway to full-time employment for top performers
- A supportive culture that values honesty, discipline, and growth
- The chance to help build an innovative AI system used in live environments
# Bonus Skills (Not required but highly valuable)
 
## Experience with:
- Twilio / voice API integrations
- WebSockets or real-time event handling
- Docker, Redis, or PostgreSQL beyond basics
- Prompt engineering or LLM fine-tuning
- Familiarity with microservice architecture
- Understanding of CI/CD pipelines or cloud deployments
- Basic knowledge of Rust (for those wanting to work on or with FastFlow)
## Ready to Apply?
We are searching for candidates who are serious about becoming world-class developers. If you're committed, capable, and ready to grow, we want to hear from you.
